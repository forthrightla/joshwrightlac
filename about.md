I’m dedicated to making the world more usable, accessible, and fun. To accomplish that, I've been working as a UX Researcher and Product Designer for over a decade, creating research-backed designs for web and mobile apps that have launched to audiences of over 33M yearly users. I have a proven track record of thriving at the intersection of business and user needs.
