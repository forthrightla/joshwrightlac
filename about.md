I've been working in product and user experience design for over a decade (two years fully remote) in enterprise, agency and start-up environments. I've created designs for web and mobile apps that have launched to over 2 million users per year, and built a community for people to share their unique creations.

I have a proven track record of innovating and streamlining creative and product workflows, empowering teams to be more efficient and allowing for greater collaboration. I wear many hats: professional mentorship, UX, UI, product strategy -- and can even speak developer.

I'm dedicated to making the world more usable and fun. Let's build something!
