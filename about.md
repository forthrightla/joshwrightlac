I've been working in product and user experience design for over a decade, most recently as a Principal Product Designer at LegalZoom, a $200M online legal technology company serving 4M+ customers. My work focus includes research, web and mobile app design, and strategic thinking for system design.

I have a proven track record of innovating and streamlining creative and product workflows, empowering teams to be more efficient and allowing for greater collaboration. 

I'm dedicated to making the world more usable and fun. Let's build something!
