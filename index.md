    content: Josh is great - period! As a designer and as a person.  As a designer
      he is a great asset with a real ability to think analytically with a common
      sense approach to complex design problems. He's very detail oriented and extremely
      capable in both UX & visual design disciplines. He is technologically savvy
      and stays current with industry trends.  As a person Josh is dependable, no
      nonsense and fun - a total pleasure to be around.

    content: 'Josh is a true team-player: he wants to learn from his colleagues and
      he wants to be proud of the overall product, not just his mockups. During the
      time we worked together, he demonstrated real resiliency as the product he worked
      on went through start-up growing pains. But he just kept focused on the work
      and turning out new ideas. He''s not about about just trying to out-creative
      the next designer but really listening to the user and using his powers of observation
      for good. '
