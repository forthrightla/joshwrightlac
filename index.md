      real resiliency as the product he worked on went through start-up growing pains.  He''s
      not about about just trying to out-creative the next designer, but really listens
      to the user and uses his powers of observation for good. '

      he is a great asset with a real ability to think analytically with a common
      sense approach to complex design problems. He's very detail oriented and extremely
      capable in both UX & visual design disciplines. As a person Josh is dependable,
      no nonsense and fun - a total pleasure to be around.
