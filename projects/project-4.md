## An organization in need

USA Jump Rope, the largest jump rope organization in the United States, has large events all over the country each year, culminating in the Jump Rope Nationals.

The processes used to run the events and the organization itself are outdated and starting to fray at the edges.

### My role

I was hired by a consulting group to conduct a two day research study at the event to help develop a strategy and potentially a software solution.

Partnered with a fellow UX researcher, we split up and conducted rapid fire contextual inquiries when we could grab peopleâ€™s time. Additionally, I did a deep dive into how the event itself was run.

Not knowing much about sports in general, I was learning as much as I could as quickly as possible.
