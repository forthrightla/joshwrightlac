## Learn, share, connect

MakerSpace was a social network created by Maker Media, the company behind **Make: Magazine** and **Maker Faire**, to bring the Maker Movement online. The core team was primarily **remote**, and acted with autonomy as a small **startup** within the larger corporation.

### My role

I was lead **Product**, **UX** and **Visual Designer** throughout the life cycle of the product, collaborating with a variety of stakeholders on everything from the art direction of promotional materials to interfacing directly with the CEO in a weekly **strategy** meeting.

Using **Agile methodology**, I worked closely with the developers, producing high-level strategy and artifacts that included **wireframes**, **high-fidelity comps** and **CSS/HTML prototypes**. We often collaborated via "pair design" sessions over video chat, iterating in real-time on the implementation of my designs. In the final stages of the product, I worked with our Product Manager on overall **strategy**, leading to our final and most successful pivot: Spaces.

### Minimum viable product

When we started the project in August 2014, the team was given an ambitious goal: launch an **MVP** at World Maker Faire New York September 20. We had **45 days**. The team rose to the challenge, iterating rapidly and building out the social platform from scratch. We onboarded our first 700 users on-site at the Faire. What follows are a few design artifacts from that first crazy month.

### A focus on mobile

As a part of the initial designs, we considered the mobile user experience of the product to be very important. To guide the responsive implementation, I provided **low-fidelity wireframes** and worked in the HTML architecture to lay the groundwork for the eventual implementation.

### Evolving our design

During the course of the project, we explored multiple design directions that would allow users to share and build their projects.
