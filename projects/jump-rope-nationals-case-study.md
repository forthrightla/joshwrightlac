## An organization in need

USA Jump Rope, the largest jump rope organization in the United States, has large events all over the country each year, culminating in the Jump Rope Nationals.

The processes used to run the events and the organization itself are outdated and starting to fray at the edges.

### My role

I was hired by a consulting group to conduct a two day research study at the event to help develop a strategy and potentially a software solution.

### Field research

Partnered with a fellow UX researcher, we split up and conducted rapid fire contextual inquiries when we could grab people’s time. Additionally, I did a deep dive into how the event itself was run.

Not knowing much about sports in general, I was learning as much as I could as quickly as possible.

### Dated legacy systems

A surprising amount of the process used to run the event is still analog, and their filing system is “a filing cabinet in a storage unit in Alabama”.

There was a tremendous opportunity for optimization.

### Understanding the event

One observation that stood out was the use of “runners.”

Each athlete competes at one of nine stations, observed by three judges.

After an event, three runners will go to each station, write down the judges’ scores, and then physically walk them over to a volunteer that types each score into an Access database.

We rapidly synthesized in the field

### Identifying opportunities

The opportunity we identified was a suite of event software that would automatically communicate with a centralized server.

Via affinity diagram, we identified which product would have the highest impact with the lowest investment, and that morning at the event I sketched out solutions.

### Prototyping my idea

After validating my idea with my fellow researcher, I designed a mobile prototype in Sketch and wired it up in Invision.

### Pitching the board of directors

After the event, I pitched the board on my software solution to huge success. Budget has recently been approved to continue exploration. Watch this space!
