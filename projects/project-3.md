## Reimagining legal forms

LegalZoom recently relaunched one of its core product offerings: Legal Forms. The redesign was extremely successful, but leadership wanted to innovate further in this space and increase market share.

### My role

As Principal Designer, I partnered with Modernist Studio, an agency headed by Jon Kolko specializing in research and strategy. Our goal was to learn about our users and develop innovative concepts.

I was embedded as an equal member of the team for three weeks. I conducted interviews,  synthesized research, and proposed hypotheses that informed later design direction.

We conducted 16 contextual inquiries in both Austin and Los Angeles. We targeted small business owners or employees that had daily experience working with legal forms.
