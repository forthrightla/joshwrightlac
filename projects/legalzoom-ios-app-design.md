## Designing LegalZoom's first iOS app

LegalZoom Estate Planning is a companion app for customers to maintain, make edits, and give family members access to their digital estate planning documents. The app also allows customers to schedule a consultation with an attorney or a tax advisor. I worked closely with a Product Manager to create the end-to-end UX and user interface design.

The app successfully launched in fall of 2016, and was LegalZoom's first iOS app.

Below is a selection of screens showcasing app functionality.
