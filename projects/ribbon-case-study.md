## Innovation at LegalZoom

LegalZoom’s LLC formation product accounts for almost half of the company’s revenue. As such, leadership is hesitant to take big risks on changing the product offering or experience.

I was hand-picked to lead product strategy and design for a small cross-functional team created as a “startup” within the broader company. The goal of the team was to create an experience independent of legacy systems and to experiment with price point, look and feel, and product offerings. All to be delivered at the end of **four weeks**.

The final site is live at <a href="http://www.ribbon.io" target="_new">ribbon.io</a>

### My role

* **Product strategy:** As Principal Designer, I partnered closely with the VPs of Marketing and Creative to determine product strategy.
* **UX & Product design:** I designed the entire experience from top to bottom, developing a design system and a visual language.
* **Engineering:** I worked closely with our engineers to ensure parity with shipped designs. This included functionality, look and feel, and animation.

### First, some context: what is a typical LegalZoom product experience?

A typical product experience consists of a **landing page**, a **questionnaire** in which customers fill out their detailed information, an **order review page**, and a **checkout page**. Some legacy questionnaires can be up to 30 pages in length.

### Determining target market

To differentiate the Ribbon experience from LegalZoom's typical customer, we decided to target downmarket customers with a free business formation experience. To visualize this, I put together a competitive landscape diagram.

### Strategy

In order to complete this project at the required velocity, I had to make informed assumptions based on existing research and design. This included competitive analyses, proto-personas, customer journey maps, and mothballed designs for similar projects that had been usability and demand tested.

### First, I determine the information architecture

After several rounds of back and forth with key stakeholders, I was able to narrow down the focus of the site to a set of key pages, which I then mapped out for easy digestion by the team.

### Assets begin shipping to Zeplin

### We start building

I partner closely with our engineer to ensure design parity.

We work in one week sprints, and use Zeplin, Slack, and video chat to communicate when we’re not on-site.

### Outcomes

To avoid overwhelming our third party vendor, in our first few weeks we decided to cap orders at 100. We also set our expectations very low on conversion rate due to the brand being unestablished.

To our surprise, our conversion rate for week one was **3.6%**, which exceeded our expectations.

### Final takeaways

Using the results from the Ribbon experiment, we were able to make a case to leadership for dramatically simplifying the existing LegalZoom LLC experience and adding more personable copy.

I worked with the LLC product team to identify screens to A/B test removing, and places in the funnel to rework the copy. When the reworked LLC was launched, conversion increased by **8%**.
